# Planned and past versions

 * 0.0.x dev
  * 0.0.1 - version I presented in school and got 5.5 (top possible grade) for, to be rewritten, *finished somewhere
in June 2013*
  * 0.0.2 - **current work in progress** - rewriting the initial version, start proper modularization
  * 0.0.3 - add support for some weirder operand types and add most of instructions from the Intel Manual
  * 0.0.4 - add compile-time expression evaluation - this will complicate the grammar a bit, but should be easily doable
 * 0.1.x alpha
  * 0.1.0 - should be able to assemble itself (or at least part of itself) compiled with Clang
